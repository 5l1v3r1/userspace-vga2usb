This is a API copy of the `v2u_dec.exe` functions, except in Cgo. This code never got used in the end. But took significant effort to make work.

Since I am likely going to do more cused mapping of Cgo in the future, I am keeping this code public, publish and most critically searchable by
github for when that time comes again.
